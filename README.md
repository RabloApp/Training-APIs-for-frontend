### **Public API for Employee Management (Training API)**

This API is built to facilitate the frontend team's training process for new joinees, enabling them to practice API integration and understand how CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations function. The API serves as a sandbox for testing and experimentation, allowing trainees to interact with an **Employee Management System**.

### **API Features:**

1. **Fields**:  
   The API uses the following fields for managing employee data:
   - **Employee ID**: A unique identifier for each employee (integer or string).
   - **Name**: Full name of the employee (string).
   - **Age**: Age of the employee (integer).
   - **Salary**: Salary of the employee (float or integer).

2. **Methods Supported**:  
   The API supports the following CRUD operations:
   - **GET**: Retrieve employee records (single or multiple).
   - **POST**: Create a new employee record.
   - **PUT (or PATCH)**: Update details of an existing employee.
   - **DELETE**: Remove an employee record from the database.

3. **Endpoints**:
   - `GET /employees`: Fetch all employee records or retrieve specific details using the employee ID.
   - `POST /employees`: Create and add a new employee to the system.
   - `PUT /employees/{id}`: Modify an employee's details using their unique ID.
   - `DELETE /employees/{id}`: Delete an employee by their unique ID.

4. **Swagger API Documentation**:  
   To enhance usability and clarity, **Swagger** will be utilized for documenting this API. This will:
   - Provide a visual and interactive interface for trainees to understand the API structure and endpoints.
   - Showcase API methods, expected parameters, and response formats.
   - Offer hands-on testing directly within the Swagger UI environment.

5. **Use Case**:  
   - Frontend trainees can use this API to simulate scenarios such as data retrieval, entry creation, updating records, and deletion workflows.
   - They will learn to integrate APIs into web applications and troubleshoot common challenges in API consumption.

6. **Error Handling**:  
   - The API will implement standard HTTP status codes (`200 OK`, `201 Created`, `400 Bad Request`, `404 Not Found`, etc.) to aid trainees in understanding response handling and debugging.

### **Purpose**:
- To provide a controlled environment for new joinees to practice API consumption and integration.
- To test their ability to perform CRUD operations and handle API responses effectively.
- To familiarize them with Swagger documentation for better understanding and testing of API functionalities.
